LICENSE AGREEMENT AND TERMS OF SERVICE.
MIT License (Expat):
We chose the MIT License (Expat) for our project because it offers the following advantages:

1-Permissive and Flexible: It allows anyone to copy, modify, and distribute the software, even in commercial projects. It imposes minimal restrictions, making it easy to integrate into any type of project.

2-Encourages Adoption: Since it is simple and clear, the MIT license makes the software appealing to both independent developers and companies, driving greater adoption and collaboration.

3-Requires Minimal Oversight: The only requirement is to retain the copyright notice, which simplifies compliance and reduces the risk of legal conflicts.

4-Compatible with Other Licenses: The MIT license works well with other open-source and commercial licenses, allowing the software to be used in larger and more complex projects without compatibility issues.

5-Promotes Innovation: Being open and permissive, it facilitates collaboration and software improvement, as developers can freely modify and contribute, speeding up development.

6-Ensures Attribution: Although permissive, it requires that the original authors be credited, providing a good balance between freedom of use and proper attribution.

In summary, the MIT license is ideal if you want an open, user-friendly, and adaptable project that supports both community development and commercial use without complex limitations.
